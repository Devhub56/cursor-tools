## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a straightforward approach to test the `cursor-tools ask` command.  First, it acknowledged the task and decided to use the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command with the question "What is 2+2?", specifying the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model. The tool execution was successful, returning the correct answer "4" along with some informational output and a warning in stderr which was not considered critical for this task.

Following the successful tool execution, the assistant analyzed the output, confirmed the correct answer and successful command completion based on the defined criteria.  Finally, it generated a JSON report summarizing the test as "PASS", highlighting the successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command, the correct response, and providing a concise summary of the outcome and execution time.

  "message": "Warning: stderr output was present",
  "details": {
    "stderr": "\n"
  }
}
```

#### Output

```
The cursor-tools ask command successfully executed with OpenAI's o3-mini model and returned the correct answer '4' to the question 'What is 2+2?'
```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a strategy of direct tool invocation to fulfill the user's request. It correctly identified the `cursor-tools ask` command as the appropriate tool to answer the user's detailed question about creating a React web application outline. The assistant then formulated the command, including the specific question, the desired provider (`openai`), and model (`o3-mini`). This command was executed using the `execute_command` tool.

Upon successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command, the assistant received a comprehensive 10-step outline detailing the process of building a React application. The outline effectively addressed all the user's requirements, including state management, routing, and API integration.  The assistant analyzed the output, confirmed the successful completion of the command and the quality of the response, and reported a "PASS" status along with a summary of the successful tool execution and the detailed outline generated.  The entire process demonstrated the assistant's ability to correctly interpret the task, select and utilize the appropriate tool, and successfully generate a detailed and relevant response using the `cursor-tools ask` functionality.

##### Tool Call 1: ✅ execute_command

**Arguments:**
```json
{
  "command": "cursor-tools ask \"Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration.\" --provider openai --model o3-mini"
}
```

**Output:**
```

1. Set Up the Development Environment: Install Node.js and create a new React project using Create React App or your preferred boilerplate. Configure your code editor with relevant extensions.

2. Define Project Structure: Organize folders for components, pages, services (for API calls), and state management (e.g., context or Redux stores) to keep your application scalable.

3. Install Required Dependencies: Add packages for routing (react-router-dom), state management (e.g., Redux with react-redux or useContext if using React hooks), and API integration (axios or the native fetch API).

4. Configure the Router: Set up react-router-dom in your main application file. Define routes for different pages, using components like BrowserRouter, Route, and Switch (or Routes in newer versions).

5. Set Up Global State Management: Depending on your choice, initialize Redux (create store, actions, reducers) or create React Context providers to handle global state such as user authentication, settings, or other shared data.

6. Create Reusable UI Components: Build modular components (header, footer, navigation) and page components that correspond to your defined routes. Ensure they adhere to a consistent style and structure.

7. Integrate API Services: Develop services for API interaction. Use axios or fetch to create functions that handle CRUD operations. Structure these functions to be reusable across components.

8. Manage Side Effects: In components that require data fetching, use useEffect (or middleware like Redux Thunk/Saga if using Redux) to retrieve data from APIs when the component mounts or state changes, handling loading and error states appropriately.

9. Implement State Synchronization with API Data: Connect API responses to your global state or local component state. Use dispatch actions or setState to update your UI dynamically based on real-time API data.

10. Test and Deploy: Write unit and integration tests for components, routing, and API calls. Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library. Optimize your application with performance tools, build the production bundle, and deploy to your chosen hosting provider.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to answer the question "What is the capital of France?".  It correctly identified the `cursor-tools ask` command as the appropriate tool for querying information. The assistant then formulated and executed this command using the `execute_command` tool, specifying the question along with the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model.

Upon receiving the output from the `cursor-tools ask` command, the assistant successfully extracted the answer "Paris".  It confirmed the successful execution of the command and the correctness of the answer.  Finally, the assistant summarized the outcome in a JSON format, reporting a "PASS" status and detailing the successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command with the correct answer obtained.
