## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully executed the task of answering "What is 2+2?" using `cursor-tools`.  The chosen strategy was to utilize the `cursor-tools ask` command, designed for querying language models. To achieve this, the assistant executed the command `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`, specifying the question, provider, and model.

The tool execution was successful, returning the correct answer "4" as the output. Although a warning message related to stderr was present in the tool's output, it did not prevent the successful completion of the task.  Based on the successful command execution and the correct answer obtained, the assistant correctly determined the outcome as a "PASS" and provided a JSON summary report reflecting this successful result.

Successfully used cursor-tools ask command with OpenAI's o3-mini model to answer the question 'What is 2+2?'. The response correctly returned '4'.
```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a strategy of directly using the `cursor-tools ask` command to fulfill the user's request for a detailed React outline.  It correctly identified `cursor-tools ask` as the appropriate tool and formulated a command specifying the question, the OpenAI provider, and the o3-mini model. This command execution was successful, resulting in a comprehensive 10-step outline for creating a React web application, addressing state management, routing, and API integration as requested.

Subsequently, the assistant attempted to use the `date +%s` command, seemingly for timekeeping or a related purpose. However, this command failed as it is not within the allowed list of executable commands. Despite this failed command, the core objective of using `cursor-tools ask` to generate the React outline was successfully achieved, demonstrating the assistant's ability to utilize the designated tool for complex information retrieval.

1. Set Up the Environment:  
   • Initialize your project using Create React App or a tool like Vite.  
   • Install core dependencies including React, React Router, and any state management libraries (e.g., Redux or rely on Context API).

2. Define the Project Structure:  
   • Organize directories for components, pages, services (for API calls), and state management.  
   • Establish naming conventions and modular file structures for scalability.

3. Configure Routing:  
   • Install React Router and set up a BrowserRouter in your main entry file.  
   • Define Routes for each view/page and create a navigation component for linking between pages.

4. Design Top-Level Components and Pages:  
   • Create reusable components (headers, footers, forms) and main pages.  
   • Implement layout components to maintain a consistent UI across routes.

5. Implement State Management:  
   • Use React’s useState and useReducer hooks for local state, or configure Context/Redux for global state.  
   • Structure your state logic to manage user data, UI state, and other app-level information.

6. Set Up API Integration:  
   • Create a dedicated service module (e.g., api.js) using fetch or axios to handle HTTP requests.  
   • Define functions for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations targeting your backend API.

7. Integrate API Calls with Components:  
   • Use useEffect to call API endpoints on component mount or in response to state changes.  
   • Update state with fetched data and handle loading and error states appropriately.

8. Manage Data Flow and Synchronization:  
   • Ensure components access and update global state when necessary (e.g., user authentication, settings).  
   • Use middleware (Redux Thunk or Sagas) if employing Redux to handle asynchronous API calls.

9. Add Error Handling and Validation:  
   • Implement error boundaries in components to catch UI errors.  
   • Validate API responses and handle request failures gracefully with user feedback.

10. Test, Optimize, and Deploy:  
    • Write unit and integration tests for components, state logic, and API interactions (using Jest/React Testing Library).  
    • Optimize performance (code-splitting, lazy-loading) and deploy your build using services like Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully executed the user's task by employing the `cursor-tools ask` command to answer the question "What is the capital of France?".  The assistant correctly identified the need to use the `execute_command` tool and formulated the appropriate command: `cursor-tools ask "What is the capital of France?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`.

Upon executing this command via the `execute_command` tool, the assistant received the output which included the correct answer "Paris".  Although the tool execution output contained a warning message in stderr, the assistant correctly recognized that the core task of retrieving the answer was successful.  Finally, the assistant generated a JSON report indicating a "PASS" status, summarizing the successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command with the specified provider and model, and confirming the correct answer was obtained.
