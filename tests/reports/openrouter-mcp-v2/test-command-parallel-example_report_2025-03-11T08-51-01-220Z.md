## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant addressed the task of testing the `cursor-tools ask` command by directly executing the specified command using the `execute_command` tool. The command `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini` was executed to ask the LLM "What is 2+2?".

Upon receiving the output from the tool execution, the assistant analyzed it to verify the command's success. The output confirmed the correct answer "4" was returned and the command completed without critical errors, despite a warning about stderr output. Based on this successful execution and correct response, the assistant generated a JSON report with a "PASS" status, summarizing the successful test and the correct answer received from the `cursor-tools ask` command.

```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to address the user's task by identifying the need to use the `cursor-tools ask` command to generate a detailed outline.  The strategy involved utilizing the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command with the user-specified question about creating a React web application outline, ensuring to include details on state management, routing, and API integration. The assistant correctly specified the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model for the query.

The execution of the `execute_command` tool was successful, resulting in the generation of a comprehensive 10-step outline as requested.  Despite a warning message in the tool output related to stderr, the core objective was achieved. The assistant parsed the output, confirmed the successful generation of the outline with the requested details, and reported a "PASS" status along with a summary of the successful execution and the generated outline content in a JSON format as requested by the user.

1. Set up the project by initializing a new React application (using Create React App, Vite, or a custom webpack setup) and organizing your folder structure for components, services, and assets.  
2. Plan your component hierarchy by outlining reusable and container components to serve as building blocks for your UI.  
3. Install and import react-router-dom, then define your routes and navigation structure to handle multiple views or pages in your application.  
4. Create the necessary components for each route and integrate your routing logic so that the app renders specific components based on the URL.  
5. Choose a state management solution (like Redux, Context API, or MobX) and configure it by creating stores or contexts to handle global state and shared data.  
6. Implement local state for components (using hooks like useState and useReducer) to manage UI-specific data and interactions.  
7. Set up an API service layer (using fetch or axios) that defines functions to make asynchronous calls to external APIs and handle responses and errors.  
8. Connect your state management logic with API integration by creating asynchronous actions (or using middleware like Redux Thunk or Sagas) to update state based on API responses.  
9. Wire up components to the global state and API service, ensuring that data flows correctly between fetching data, storing it in state, and rendering output for each route.  
10. Test and refine the application by writing unit and integration tests for components, routing, and API integration, then deploy the final build to your chosen hosting platform.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully executed the user's task by directly using the `cursor-tools ask` command.  The assistant determined the appropriate command and parameters (`cursor-tools ask "What is the capital of France?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`) to answer the question. This command was executed using the `execute_command` tool.

The tool execution was successful, returning the correct answer "The capital of France is Paris." The assistant parsed the output, confirmed the correct answer and successful execution, and then generated a JSON response indicating a "PASS" status, summarizing the successful execution and including the execution time.  The overall strategy was a direct execution of the requested tool command to fulfill the user's information retrieval task.
