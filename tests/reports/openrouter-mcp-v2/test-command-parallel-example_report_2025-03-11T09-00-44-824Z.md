## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a straightforward approach to answer the question "What is 2+2?" using `cursor-tools`.  It correctly identified the `cursor-tools ask` command as the appropriate tool for querying a language model directly.  The assistant then used the `execute_command` tool to execute the command `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`, specifying the provider and model to use for the query.

Upon successful execution of the command, the assistant received the output containing the correct answer "4". It parsed this output, confirming the successful execution and correct answer. Finally, the assistant generated a JSON response summarizing the test as a "PASS", including a brief description of the successful command execution, the correct answer obtained, and an execution time, indicating a successful completion of the user's task.

Successfully executed cursor-tools ask command with OpenAI's o3-mini model. The command returned the correct answer '4' to the question 'What is 2+2?'
```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a strategy of using the `cursor-tools ask` command to address the user's request for a detailed outline.  It correctly identified and executed the command with the appropriate arguments, specifying the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model to generate a 10-step outline for React web application development. This tool execution was successful, resulting in a comprehensive outline that included details on state management, routing, and API integration as requested.

Following the successful execution of `cursor-tools ask`, the assistant attempted to use the `date` command, which was promptly blocked due to security restrictions on permitted commands.  While this second tool call failed, the primary objective of using `cursor-tools ask` to generate the React outline was successfully achieved, demonstrating the assistant's ability to leverage the intended tool for complex information retrieval as instructed by the user.

  "command": "cursor-tools ask \"Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration.\" --provider openai --model o3-mini"
}
```

**Output:**

1. Set Up the Development Environment: Install Node.js and use create-react-app (or a similar starter) to scaffold your project structure.  
2. Plan the Application Structure: Define folders for components, pages, services, and assets to maintain a clean and modular codebase.  
3. Configure Routing: Install and set up React Router to define route paths and connect them to individual page components.  
4. Establish State Management: Choose a state management solution (React Context, Redux, or Recoil), then configure the store/provider to manage global state.  
5. Create Reusable UI Components: Build foundational components (e.g., headers, footers, buttons) and design them to be flexible and reusable.  
6. Develop Page Components: Combine UI components and stateful logic to create full-page components that represent different views in your application.  
7. Integrate APIs: Set up API services using fetch or a library like Axios, structuring functions to handle GET, POST, and other HTTP requests.  
8. Manage State with API Data: Connect API calls with your state management solution by dispatching actions or updating context when data is fetched or modified.  
9. Address Error Handling and Loading States: Implement error boundaries, loading spinners, and fallback UIs to provide feedback during API requests or state transitions.  
10. Test, Optimize, and Deploy: Write unit and integration tests for components, optimize performance (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading), and deploy the application using a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or a custom server.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully executed the user's task by employing the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command.  The assistant correctly formulated the command as `cursor-tools ask "What is the capital of France?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`, specifying the question, provider, and model. This command was executed, and the tool output confirms the successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command, resulting in the correct answer "Paris.".

Based on the successful tool execution, the assistant then generated a JSON report indicating a "PASS" status. This report summarized the successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command, highlighting the correct answer and the absence of errors.  The overall strategy was direct and effective, leveraging the `execute_command` tool to directly invoke the required `cursor-tools` functionality and subsequently reporting the outcome in a structured JSON format.
