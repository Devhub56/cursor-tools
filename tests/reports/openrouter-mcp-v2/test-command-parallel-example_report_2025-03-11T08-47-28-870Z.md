## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully executed the task by using the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command.  The assistant correctly determined the command should be: `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`. This command was then passed to the `execute_command` tool.

The tool execution was successful, returning the correct answer "4" along with informational messages about environment file loading.  Based on this successful output, the assistant correctly identified the test as a "PASS" and provided a JSON formatted response summarizing the successful execution, including a concise summary and execution time. The assistant confirmed all success criteria were met, including correct command usage, successful execution without errors (despite a warning message in stderr), correct answer, and reasonable execution time.

```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct question-answering approach using the `cursor-tools ask` command to fulfill the user's request.  Recognizing the need to generate a detailed outline for React web application development, the assistant correctly identified `cursor-tools ask` as the appropriate tool and formulated a command that included the user's question along with specifying the `--provider openai` and `--model o3-mini` to ensure a comprehensive response from a capable AI model.

The `execute_command` tool was then successfully used to run the formulated `cursor-tools ask` command. The execution yielded a detailed 10-step outline as requested, covering state management, routing, and API integration in React applications.  The assistant then processed the successful output, confirmed that the command completed without errors and that the response was comprehensive, and finally provided a JSON summary indicating a "PASS" status along with a descriptive summary of the successful execution and the generated outline.

1. Define the application requirements and architecture, choosing React as the UI library along with a state management strategy (e.g., Context API or Redux), a routing solution (e.g., React Router), and an approach for API integration (e.g., Axios or Fetch API).

2. Initialize your project using Create React App or an alternative (like Vite) to set up a modern development environment with appropriate tooling.

3. Organize your project structure by creating directories for components, pages, services (for API calls), state management (store, actions, reducers or contexts), and routing configurations.

4. Install necessary dependencies including react-router-dom for client-side routing, a state management library if needed (Redux, MobX, etc.), and an HTTP client like Axios for API integration.

5. Configure routing by setting up React Router in your application entry point (usually in App.js), defining routes for different pages or components, and using <BrowserRouter> along with <Switch> (or <Routes>) to manage navigation.

6. Set up global state management by creating a central store or context; define state slices and actions (or dispatch functions) to manage shared data, ensuring your components can subscribe to relevant state changes.

7. Develop reusable React components and pages, connecting UI elements to the global state using hooks (useState, useContext, or useSelector/useDispatch for Redux) and passing props as needed.

8. Integrate API calls by creating a service layer that uses Axios or the Fetch API to interact with backend endpoints; handle request/response, error checking, and loading states, then dispatch updates to your state management system accordingly.

9. Implement efficient error handling, loading indicators, and data caching strategies to ensure a responsive user experience while the application fetches data from APIs, and manage state transitions smoothly across routed components.

10. Test the application (unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests), optimize the performance and bundle size, then deploy the application using modern hosting platforms (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or AWS) with proper configuration for routing on the server.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to fulfill the user's task of querying the capital of France using `cursor-tools`.  The key strategy involved directly utilizing the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command.  The assistant correctly formulated the command as `cursor-tools ask "What is the capital of France?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`, specifying the question, provider, and model.

Upon execution of this command using the `execute_command` tool, the `cursor-tools ask` command successfully retrieved the answer "Paris".  The tool execution was successful, and the assistant subsequently reported the successful outcome in JSON format, confirming that the correct answer was obtained and all success criteria were met as outlined in the original task description. There were no failed tool calls in this process; the interaction focused on a single successful command execution.
