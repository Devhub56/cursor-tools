## Description

This test verifies that tests are run in an isolated folder

## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Test commands run in an isolated folder (Other)

#### Task Description

We're going to verify that cursor-tools test commands run in an isolated folder. You are inside a test so all you need to do is use ls to figure out if you're in a suitably isolated folder.
Test folders are creted new for each test and populated only with a symlink to the node_modules folder
- The current directory should NOT contain source code
- The current directory should NOT be a git repository
- The current directory should have the expected folders that tests require
- The current directory contains a node_modules folder which is a symlink
- The current directory does not contain a .git folder
- The current directory does not contain a src folder

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a systematic approach to verify the isolation of the test folder.  The strategy was to use command-line tools to inspect the current directory and confirm it met the specified criteria for isolation.  The assistant used `ls -la` to list directory contents, confirming the presence of expected files and the `node_modules` symlink, and the absence of obvious source code files. Subsequently, `find` commands were used to explicitly check for the absence of `.git` and `src` folders, further validating the isolation criteria.  Finally, `ls -l node_modules` was used to confirm that `node_modules` was indeed a symbolic link.

While attempting to measure execution time with `date +%s`, the assistant encountered a restriction on allowed commands and received an error. Despite this, the assistant successfully gathered enough information through the allowed commands to verify all isolation criteria and confidently concluded that the test environment was properly isolated, returning a "PASS" status in the final JSON output.

##### Tool Call 4: ✅ execute_command

**Arguments:**
```json
{
  "command": "ls -l node_modules"
}
```

##### Tool Call 5: ❌ execute_command

**Arguments:**
```json
{
  "command": "date +%s"
}
```

**Output:**
```
Command 'date' is not allowed. Permitted commands are: cursor-tools and [ls, cat, grep, find, sqlite3]
```

**Error:**
```json
{
  "message": "Command not allowed",
  "details": {
    "command": "date",
    "allowedCommands": [
      "cursor-tools",
      "ls",
      "cat",
      "grep",
      "find",
      "sqlite3"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

#### Output

```
The test environment is properly isolated. The current directory does not contain source code, is not a git repository, does not have a .git folder, does not have a src folder, and contains a node_modules folder that is correctly set up as a symlink to the main project's node_modules.
