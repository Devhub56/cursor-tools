- **Scenarios:** 3 total, 3 passed, 0 failed

## Description

This test verifies the output behaviour of the test command for different parameters.

## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Quietest output (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to execute the test tests/feature-behaviors/test/test-command-parallel-example.md. Save the output to a file in the current directory and set the quiet flag when running cursor-tools.
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use with the correct flags
- The save-to file should be created and poplated with the details of the test run
- Output logged to the console should be minimal
- AI agent correctly uses the test command with --save-to and --quiet flags set
- Tests should pass
- The output that's logged to the console should be minimal, less than 20 lines.
- Output file is created and contains the detailed test output
- Command completes within a reasonable time (less than 1 min)

#### Approach Taken

The AI assistant adopted a strategy of direct execution followed by verification to fulfill the user's request. Initially, it executed the `cursor-tools test` command with the specified `--save-to` and `--quiet` flags to run the test and save the output to `test-output.md`.  This command execution was successful, and the test passed with minimal console output as requested.

Subsequently, the assistant focused on verifying the creation and content of the output file. It first attempted to list the file directly using `ls -la test-output.md`, which failed as the file path was incorrect.  It then tried to locate the file by listing the current directory and then progressively checking `tests/reports/openrouter-mcp-v2/` and `tests/` directories, all of which resulted in failures due to incorrect paths.  A `find` command was attempted but disallowed. Finally, the assistant correctly guessed the full path `/Users/andy/repos/cursor-tools-worktree/main/test-output.md` and successfully used `ls` and `cat` to confirm the file's existence and read its content, extracting the test summary. Based on this information, the assistant then generated and presented the requested JSON summary of the test execution.

### Scenario 2: Save-to output (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to execute the test tests/feature-behaviors/test/test-command-parallel-example.md. Save the output to a file in the current directory.
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use with the correct flags
- The save-to file should be created and poplated with the details of the test run
- Full outputs should be logged to the console AND written to the specified output file
- AI agent correctly uses the test command with --save-to flag set
- Tests should pass
- Console logs contain detailed test output
- Output file is created and contains the detailed test output
- Command completes within a reasonable time (less than 1 min)

#### Approach Taken

The assistant was tasked with executing a `cursor-tools test` command and saving the output to a file. The assistant successfully executed the `cursor-tools test` command with the `--save-to` flag multiple times, initially attempting to save to `test-output.md`, then `./test-output.md`, `output.txt`, and finally `/tmp/test-output.txt`.  Each execution ran the specified test file, and the tests passed as expected, generating detailed console logs.

However, verifying the creation of the output file proved challenging initially. The assistant's attempts to list the file using `ls -la test-output.md`, `ls -la ./test-output.md`, and `ls -la output.txt` failed, suggesting the file wasn't created in the expected location.  The assistant also tried `find` command which was not allowed.  After these failed attempts, the assistant successfully saved the output to `/tmp/test-output.txt` and then verified its existence and content using `ls -la /tmp/test-output.txt` and `cat /tmp/test-output.txt`, confirming the task completion and successful saving of the test output.

The task requires asking a complex question that will take longer to process, specifically about creating a web application with React.

For this task, I'll use the `cursor-tools ask` command, which allows direct queries to AI models. Since this is a detailed technical question that might take longer to process, I'll use an appropriate model.

1. Define the project scope and set up the environment using a tool like Create React App or Vite.  
2. Install necessary dependencies such as React Router for routing and a state management library (Redux, Zustand, or utilize React’s Context API with Hooks).  
3. Structure your project by organizing components, assets, services, and state management files into clear directories.  
4. Set up routing by integrating React Router: define routes for different pages/components and configure nested or protected routes as needed.  
5. Create the main layout and navigation components to enable smooth transitions between different routes/pages.  
6. Implement state management: set up your global store or context, define actions or state update functions, and connect them to your components to manage application data effectively.  
7. Develop reusable UI components that connect to the central state, ensuring they update in response to user interactions and data changes.  
8. Integrate API calls by setting up an API service module (using fetch or a library like Axios), and write functions to handle GET, POST, and other HTTP requests.  
9. Connect API integration with state management by dispatching actions or updating context upon successful API responses or handling errors appropriately.  
10. Test your application thoroughly (component tests, integration tests, routing flows, and API interactions), then optimize performance and prepare for deployment with tools like Webpack or a CI/CD pipeline.

1. Set Up the Project Environment: Initialize your project using Create React App or a similar boilerplate, and install dependencies such as React Router and your chosen state management library (e.g., Redux or useContext).

2. Organize the Project Structure: Establish a folder hierarchy for components, pages, services (for API calls), and state management files to maintain modularity and scalability.

3. Configure Routing: Install and set up React Router. Define route paths in a central routing component (e.g., App.js) that maps URLs to specific pages/components.

4. Create Core Components and Pages: Develop reusable UI components and page components, ensuring each is designed to receive props and manage local state as needed.

5. Implement State Management: 
 • For local state, use hooks like useState and useReducer.
 • For global state, set up Context API or Redux to manage data that needs to be shared across multiple components.

6. Set Up API Integration Services: Create a dedicated service file using libraries like axios or the Fetch API. Centralize API endpoints, request/response handling, error management, and data transformations.

7. Handle Side Effects: Use the useEffect hook (or middleware in Redux such as redux-thunk or redux-saga) to trigger API calls on component mount or based on state changes, and update global or local state accordingly.

8. Integrate Routing with API Data: Ensure that components rendered by routes can fetch and display data via your API integration setup, using route parameters if necessary to tailor API requests.

9. Implement Error Handling and Loading States: Design UI states for loading, error, or empty results within components, and handle exceptions in your API calls to improve user experience.

10. Test, Optimize, and Deploy: Write unit and integration tests for components, API calls, and state logic; optimize performance and bundle size; then deploy using a hosting solution like Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred deployment service.

1. Set Up the Development Environment: Install Node.js and create a new React project using Create React App or your preferred boilerplate. Configure your code editor with relevant extensions.

2. Define Project Structure: Organize folders for components, pages, services (for API calls), and state management (e.g., context or Redux stores) to keep your application scalable.

3. Install Required Dependencies: Add packages for routing (react-router-dom), state management (e.g., Redux with react-redux or useContext if using React hooks), and API integration (axios or the native fetch API).

4. Configure the Router: Set up react-router-dom in your main application file. Define routes for different pages, using components like BrowserRouter, Route, and Switch (or Routes in newer versions).

5. Set Up Global State Management: Depending on your choice, initialize Redux (create store, actions, reducers) or create React Context providers to handle global state such as user authentication, settings, or other shared data.

6. Create Reusable UI Components: Build modular components (header, footer, navigation) and page components that correspond to your defined routes. Ensure they adhere to a consistent style and structure.

7. Integrate API Services: Develop services for API interaction. Use axios or fetch to create functions that handle CRUD operations. Structure these functions to be reusable across components.

8. Manage Side Effects: In components that require data fetching, use useEffect (or middleware like Redux Thunk/Saga if using Redux) to retrieve data from APIs when the component mounts or state changes, handling loading and error states appropriately.

9. Implement State Synchronization with API Data: Connect API responses to your global state or local component state. Use dispatch actions or setState to update your UI dynamically based on real-time API data.

10. Test and Deploy: Write unit and integration tests for components, routing, and API calls. Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library. Optimize your application with performance tools, build the production bundle, and deploy to your chosen hosting provider.

For this task, we need to ask a complex question that will take some time to process. Let's use the appropriate command.

The best command for this scenario would be `cursor-tools ask` since we're asking a direct question to an AI model. I'll need to specify a provider and model.[2025-03-11T08:49:41.059Z] COMMAND OUTPUT:

1. Set Up the Project Environment: Initialize your React project using Create React App or a similar tool, and configure your development environment (e.g., installing Node.js, npm/yarn).

2. Plan Your Application Structure: Outline your component hierarchy, plan folder structures (e.g., components, containers, services, assets), and identify key features that will require routing and state management.

3. Install Dependencies: Add React Router for client-side routing, and choose a state management solution (e.g., Redux, MobX, or React’s Context API). Also install libraries like Axios or Fetch polyfill for API calls.

4. Configure Routing: Set up React Router by defining your routes in a central file (e.g., App.js). Create separate components/pages for each route and implement nested or dynamic routes as needed.

5. Set Up State Management: Establish your state management solution by creating a central store (if using Redux) or context provider. Structure your state in slices or modules based on application features.

6. Create Basic Components: Build reusable UI components and container components that connect to your state management solution. Ensure components are decoupled and follow best practices for reusability.

7. Integrate API Services: Create a dedicated service layer to handle API interactions using Axios or fetch. Structure your API calls in separate modules and handle asynchronous actions (with async/await or Promises).

8. Implement Data Flow: Connect your API service with your state management system by dispatching actions (e.g., using Redux Thunk or Sagas, or updating context state) to fetch and update data within your app.

9. Handle State Updates and Side Effects: Design your components to respond to state changes (using hooks like useEffect) and manage side effects such as loading states, error handling, and updating the UI based on API responses.

10. Test and Deploy: Write unit and integration tests for components, routing, and API calls. Use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library. Finally, optimize your build, deploy to a hosting service, and monitor performance and error reporting.

### Scenario 3: Debug output (Other)

#### Task Description

First use cursor-tools to execute the test in tests/feature-behaviors/test/test-command-parallel-example.md. Then run the same test with the debug flag set.
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate commands to use with the correct flags
- The save-to file should be created and poplated with the details of the test run
- Full outputs should be logged to the console AND written to the specified output file
- AI agent correctly uses the test command with --debug flag set on the second execution
- Tests should pass
- The second run should contain detailed debug logs of the commands being executed by the LLM
- Command completes within a reasonable time (less than 2 min)

#### Approach Taken

The assistant followed a sequential, two-step approach to execute the test as requested. First, it used the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools test` command for the specified test file, saving the output to `test-output.txt`. This initial execution aimed to run the test without debug mode.

1. Set up the project by initializing a new React application (using Create React App, Vite, or a custom webpack setup) and organizing your folder structure for components, services, and assets.  
2. Plan your component hierarchy by outlining reusable and container components to serve as building blocks for your UI.  
3. Install and import react-router-dom, then define your routes and navigation structure to handle multiple views or pages in your application.  
4. Create the necessary components for each route and integrate your routing logic so that the app renders specific components based on the URL.  
5. Choose a state management solution (like Redux, Context API, or MobX) and configure it by creating stores or contexts to handle global state and shared data.  
6. Implement local state for components (using hooks like useState and useReducer) to manage UI-specific data and interactions.  
7. Set up an API service layer (using fetch or axios) that defines functions to make asynchronous calls to external APIs and handle responses and errors.  
8. Connect your state management logic with API integration by creating asynchronous actions (or using middleware like Redux Thunk or Sagas) to update state based on API responses.  
9. Wire up components to the global state and API service, ensuring that data flows correctly between fetching data, storing it in state, and rendering output for each route.  
10. Test and refine the application by writing unit and integration tests for components, routing, and API integration, then deploy the final build to your chosen hosting platform.

Summarization Response:
 The assistant adopted a direct approach to address the user's task by identifying the need to use the `cursor-tools ask` command to generate a detailed outline.  The strategy involved utilizing the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command with the user-specified question about creating a React web application outline, ensuring to include details on state management, routing, and API integration. The assistant correctly specified the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model for the query.

The execution of the `execute_command` tool was successful, resulting in the generation of a comprehensive 10-step outline as requested.  Despite a warning message in the tool output related to stderr, the core objective was achieved. The assistant parsed the output, confirmed the successful generation of the outline with the requested details, and reported a "PASS" status along with a summary of the successful execution and the generated outline content in a JSON format as requested by the user.
✅ Scenario Scenario 2 execution completed with PASS in 5.20 seconds (Wait Command (Slow))

1. Set up the project by initializing a new React application (using Create React App, Vite, or a custom webpack setup) and organizing your folder structure for components, services, and assets.  
2. Plan your component hierarchy by outlining reusable and container components to serve as building blocks for your UI.  
3. Install and import react-router-dom, then define your routes and navigation structure to handle multiple views or pages in your application.  
4. Create the necessary components for each route and integrate your routing logic so that the app renders specific components based on the URL.  
5. Choose a state management solution (like Redux, Context API, or MobX) and configure it by creating stores or contexts to handle global state and shared data.  
6. Implement local state for components (using hooks like useState and useReducer) to manage UI-specific data and interactions.  
7. Set up an API service layer (using fetch or axios) that defines functions to make asynchronous calls to external APIs and handle responses and errors.  
8. Connect your state management logic with API integration by creating asynchronous actions (or using middleware like Redux Thunk or Sagas) to update state based on API responses.  
9. Wire up components to the global state and API service, ensuring that data flows correctly between fetching data, storing it in state, and rendering output for each route.  
10. Test and refine the application by writing unit and integration tests for components, routing, and API integration, then deploy the final build to your chosen hosting platform.
