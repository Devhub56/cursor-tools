## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant addressed the task of answering "What is 2+2?" using `cursor-tools` by first identifying the `cursor-tools ask` command as the appropriate tool for direct queries to AI models. It then formulated the command `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`, specifying the question, provider, and model as required.

This command was executed using the `execute_command` tool. The tool execution was successful, returning the correct answer "4".  Although a warning message was present in the stderr output, the assistant correctly focused on the successful execution and the presence of the correct answer in the output stream.  Based on this positive outcome, the assistant summarized the test as a "PASS" and provided a JSON object detailing the successful execution and key details.

```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to fulfill the user's task.  It first recognized the need to use `cursor-tools ask` to answer the user's question about a React outline.  Subsequently, the assistant executed the `execute_command` tool, providing the precise `cursor-tools ask` command with the user's question, specifying the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model.

This tool execution was successful, producing a detailed 10-step outline for creating a React web application, covering state management, routing, and API integration as requested.  The assistant then analyzed the tool output, confirmed the successful execution and the quality of the generated outline, and reported a "PASS" status with a summary detailing the successful command execution and the comprehensive nature of the response.  No failed tool calls occurred in this scenario.

{
  "command": "cursor-tools ask \"Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration.\" --provider openai --model o3-mini"
}
```

**Output:**

1. Initialize the Project: Use Create React App or Vite to set up your project environment and install necessary dependencies.
2. Plan the Application Structure: Define a component hierarchy and folder structure to separate UI components, state management logic, and API services.
3. Configure Routing: Install and set up react-router-dom to handle client-side routing, creating routes for different pages and views.
4. Design UI Components: Build reusable, presentational components using functional components and hooks for managing local state.
5. Set Up State Management: Choose between Context API for simple shared state or Redux/MobX for complex state management, and configure global state.
6. Integrate API Communication: Set up API utilities using fetch or axios to handle RESTful API calls, including error handling and data transformation.
7. Manage Asynchronous Data: Implement loading and error states within your components or state management layer to manage API requests effectively.
8. Connect Components to Global State: Use hooks like useContext or Redux’s useSelector/useDispatch to integrate components with global state and reflect API data.
9. Implement Side Effects: Utilize useEffect hooks (or middleware like Redux Thunk/Saga) to trigger API calls and synchronize component state when routing or user actions change.
10. Test and Deploy: Write unit and integration tests for components, routes, and API services, then build, optimize, and deploy the application to a hosting provider.

#### Output

```
Successfully executed cursor-tools ask command with OpenAI o3-mini model. The response provided a comprehensive 10-step outline for creating a React web application, including the requested details on state management (step 5), routing (step 3), and API integration (steps 6-7).

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant addressed the task by utilizing the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command.  It correctly formulated the command as `cursor-tools ask "What is the capital of France?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`, selecting the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model as specified in the implied requirements of using `cursor-tools`.

The `execute_command` tool successfully executed this command, which in turn correctly used `cursor-tools` to answer the question and return "Paris" as the capital of France.  The assistant then parsed the tool output, confirmed the correct answer and successful execution, and generated a JSON response with a "PASS" status, summarizing the successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command and the accurate answer obtained.
