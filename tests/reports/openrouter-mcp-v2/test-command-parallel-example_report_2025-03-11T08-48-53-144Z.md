## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to answer the question "What is 2+2?" using `cursor-tools`.  It correctly identified the `cursor-tools ask` command as the appropriate tool for querying a language model. The assistant then utilized the `execute_command` tool to run the command: `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`, specifying the OpenAI provider and `o3-mini` model.

The execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command was successful, as indicated by the tool output which included the correct answer "4".  Despite a warning message in the stderr, the assistant interpreted the overall execution as successful, confirmed by the presence of the correct answer in the output.  Based on this successful tool execution, the assistant concluded that the task was completed successfully and reported a "PASS" status along with a summary of the successful execution and the correct answer obtained.

```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to fulfill the user's request by utilizing the `cursor-tools ask` command.  It correctly identified and executed the command with the appropriate parameters (`--provider openai --model o3-mini`) to generate a 10-step outline for React web application development, as instructed. This resulted in a successful tool execution that produced a comprehensive and well-structured outline covering the key aspects of state management, routing, and API integration in React applications.

Subsequently, the assistant attempted to use the `date` command, likely to measure execution time or for another internal purpose. However, this tool execution failed because the `date` command is not permitted within the allowed toolset. Despite this minor failed attempt, the core task of using `cursor-tools ask` to generate the React outline was successfully completed, demonstrating the assistant's ability to understand and execute complex instructions using the specified tool.

}
```

**Output:**
```

1. Set Up the Project Environment: Initialize your project using Create React App or a similar boilerplate, and install dependencies such as React Router and your chosen state management library (e.g., Redux or useContext).

2. Organize the Project Structure: Establish a folder hierarchy for components, pages, services (for API calls), and state management files to maintain modularity and scalability.

3. Configure Routing: Install and set up React Router. Define route paths in a central routing component (e.g., App.js) that maps URLs to specific pages/components.

4. Create Core Components and Pages: Develop reusable UI components and page components, ensuring each is designed to receive props and manage local state as needed.

5. Implement State Management: 
 • For local state, use hooks like useState and useReducer.
 • For global state, set up Context API or Redux to manage data that needs to be shared across multiple components.

6. Set Up API Integration Services: Create a dedicated service file using libraries like axios or the Fetch API. Centralize API endpoints, request/response handling, error management, and data transformations.

7. Handle Side Effects: Use the useEffect hook (or middleware in Redux such as redux-thunk or redux-saga) to trigger API calls on component mount or based on state changes, and update global or local state accordingly.

8. Integrate Routing with API Data: Ensure that components rendered by routes can fetch and display data via your API integration setup, using route parameters if necessary to tailor API requests.

9. Implement Error Handling and Loading States: Design UI states for loading, error, or empty results within components, and handle exceptions in your API calls to improve user experience.

10. Test, Optimize, and Deploy: Write unit and integration tests for components, API calls, and state logic; optimize performance and bundle size; then deploy using a hosting solution like Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred deployment service.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant followed a direct approach to address the user's task of asking "What is the capital of France?" using `cursor-tools`.  The strategy involved identifying the `cursor-tools ask` command as the appropriate tool to query a language model. The assistant then utilized the `execute_command` tool to run the command `cursor-tools ask "What is the capital of France?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`.

Upon executing the command, the assistant received the output which contained the correct answer, "Paris", along with execution details.  Although a warning related to stderr was present in the tool output, the assistant correctly interpreted the execution as successful since the core task of retrieving the capital of France was achieved and the correct answer was obtained.  Finally, the assistant summarized the test as a "PASS" and provided a JSON report detailing the successful execution and the correct answer.
