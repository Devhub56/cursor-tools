## Description

This test verifies that the test command can execute multiple scenarios in parallel, reducing overall test execution time.

## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully executed the task by directly using the `cursor-tools ask` command to answer the question "What is 2+2?".  The assistant identified the appropriate command `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini` and utilized the `execute_command` tool to run it.

The tool execution was successful, returning the correct answer '4'.  Based on the successful execution and correct answer, the assistant generated a JSON report indicating a "PASS" status for the test scenario, summarizing the successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command and the retrieval of the correct answer.

```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to address the user's task of generating a React web application outline using `cursor-tools`.  Recognizing the task as a question-based request without requiring repository context, the assistant strategically chose the `cursor-tools ask` command. It then executed this command via the `execute_command` tool, embedding the user's question about the 10

1. Define project requirements and set up the environment using Create React App or a similar boilerplate.
2. Plan the project structure by organizing folders for components, assets, services, and state management.
3. Install essential dependencies such as React Router for routing, a state management library (e.g., Redux or useContext with useReducer), and an HTTP client (like Axios or Fetch API).
4. Configure routing with React Router by setting up BrowserRouter, defining Routes, and creating page components for different paths.
5. Design state management by choosing a solution (e.g., Redux or Context API) and setting up a store, actions, reducers, or context providers to handle global state.
6. Create reusable React components (functional components with hooks) that consume state and props to build the UI.
7. Integrate API calls by configuring Axios/fetch in a separate service module, handling asynchronous operations using async/await or promises, and managing errors.
8. Connect API data to your components by dispatching actions or updating context state once data is fetched, and display the results in the UI.
9. Implement component-specific routing and state updates (e.g., protected routes, lazy loading components) to enhance performance and maintainability.
10. Test and deploy by writing unit and integration tests, implementing error boundaries, optimizing performance (e.g., code splitting), and deploying the application using a hosting service.

#### Output

```
Successfully executed cursor-tools ask command with OpenAI o3-mini model.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct execution strategy to answer the question "What is the capital of France?".  It utilized the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command with the specified provider and model (`openai`, `o3-mini`). This command was designed to query for the capital of France.

The tool execution was successful, returning the correct answer "Paris" along with execution logs.  Based on this successful output, the assistant correctly identified the task as completed and generated a JSON report indicating a "PASS" status. The summary in the JSON report confirmed the successful execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command and the retrieval of the correct capital of France.
