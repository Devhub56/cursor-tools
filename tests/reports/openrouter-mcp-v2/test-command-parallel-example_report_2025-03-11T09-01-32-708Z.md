## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully addressed the task of answering "What is 2+2?" using `cursor-tools`. The approach involved using the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command.  The assistant correctly identified the need to use the `ask` subcommand along with specifying the `--provider openai` and `--model o3-mini` to execute the query.

The execution of the `cursor-tools ask` command was successful. It returned the correct answer "4" and completed without critical errors, although a warning about stderr output was present in the tool output. Based on the successful execution and correct answer, the assistant reported a "PASS" status and summarized the successful execution of the command in the provided JSON format, confirming that all success criteria were met.

Successfully executed cursor-tools ask command with OpenAI's o3-mini model. The command returned the correct answer '4' to the question 'What is 2+2?'
```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant addressed the user's request by employing the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools ask` command.  The chosen command was designed to query the `o3-mini` model from OpenAI with the user's question regarding a 10-step outline for React web application development, specifically focusing on state management, routing, and API integration.

This execution of `cursor-tools ask` was successful, generating a comprehensive 10-step outline as requested. The outline provided detailed steps and incorporated the required elements of state management, routing, and API integration within the React context.  Following the successful tool execution, the assistant correctly interpreted the output and provided a JSON summary indicating a "PASS" status, confirming the successful completion of the user's task.

1. Set Up the Project: Use Create React App or a similar boilerplate to initialize your project, ensuring your development environment has the latest Node.js and npm versions installed.

2. Install Dependencies: Add necessary libraries such as react-router-dom for client-side routing, a state management tool (like Redux, MobX, or the React Context API), and an HTTP client such as axios or fetch for API calls.

3. Plan Component Architecture: Outline the key components (views, headers, footers, etc.), their hierarchy, and design reusable components to keep your code modular and maintainable.

4. Configure Routing: Set up react-router-dom by defining routes in your App component, using BrowserRouter, Switch, and Route components to map URLs to their corresponding page components.

5. Set Up State Management: Choose a strategy—Context API for simpler apps or Redux for more complex ones. Configure your store or provider, create actions and reducers (if using Redux), and establish global state for cross-component data sharing.

6. Develop Core UI Components: Build the basic UI components and integrate them with routing. Utilize props and state to manage local component data and ensure proper rendering based on route changes.

7. Integrate API Calls: Create a service layer to manage API interactions. Use axios or fetch within lifecycle methods (or React hooks like useEffect) to fetch data from external APIs, and handle responses and errors properly.

8. Connect API Data to State Management: Dispatch actions or update context with the fetched API data. Ensure components subscribe to state changes to dynamically render the updated data.

9. Implement Error Handling and Loading States: Incorporate error boundaries, loading indicators, and proper error messaging within components during API calls or state updates to improve user experience.

10. Test, Optimize, and Deploy: Write unit tests for components, routing logic, and API integrations using tools like Jest or React Testing Library. Optimize performance through code-splitting and lazy loading, then deploy your application to a hosting platform such as Netlify, Vercel, or a cloud service provider.

#### Output

```
Successfully executed cursor-tools ask command with OpenAI's o3-mini model. The command returned a comprehensive 10-step outline for creating a React web application that included the requested details on state management (step 5), routing (step 4), and API integration (steps 7-8).
```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 8.20 seconds

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully executed the task by using the `cursor-tools ask` command to answer the question "What is the capital of France?".  The chosen command included the `--provider openai` and `--model o3-mini` parameters. The assistant used the `execute_command` tool with the constructed `cursor-tools ask` command.

The execution of the command was successful, returning the correct answer "The capital of France is Paris."  While a warning about stderr output was present in the tool execution logs, the assistant correctly interpreted the overall outcome as a success because the core requirements of answering the question correctly and using the specified tool were met. The assistant then reported a "PASS" status with a summary of the successful execution and the correct answer.
