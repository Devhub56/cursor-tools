## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant addressed the task of answering "What is 2+2?" using `cursor-tools` by employing the `execute_command` tool.  It formulated the command `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini` to directly query the OpenAI `o3-mini` model via the `cursor-tools ask` functionality.

Upon executing this command, the tool successfully returned the correct answer "4". The assistant then parsed this output, verified the correctness of the answer and the successful execution of the command.  Based on these positive results, the assistant concluded that the test was a "PASS" and provided a JSON summary confirming the successful execution and outcome, highlighting that the correct command was used, the answer was correct, and the execution was successful within a reasonable timeframe.

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to fulfill the user's request by utilizing the `cursor-tools ask` command.  Recognizing the need to query an AI model for a detailed outline, the assistant selected this tool and formulated the command with the user's specified question: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."  The command was executed successfully using the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model, resulting in a comprehensive 10-step outline that addressed all aspects of the request, including state management, routing, and API integration in React.

In summary, the strategy was to directly query an LLM using the `cursor-tools ask` command with a specific prompt and model. The execution of the `execute_command` tool with the constructed `cursor-tools ask` command was successful, yielding a detailed and relevant outline as requested by the user. This demonstrates a focused approach using the appropriate tool to directly address the user's information need.

1. Initialize the Project: Use Create React App or your preferred boilerplate, install dependencies, and set up your version control.
2. Organize Project Structure: Define folders for components, pages, assets, services, and state management (store or contexts).
3. Install and Configure Routing: Add react-router-dom, define routes in a central file, and create a navigation component to link pages.
4. Choose State Management Approach: Decide between Context API for simple state or Redux/MobX for more complex scenarios; install necessary libraries if needed.
5. Set Up Global State Management: Create state provider or Redux store, and define actions/reducers (or context actions) for managing global state.
6. Design Core Components and Pages: Develop reusable UI components and container components representing each route/page.
7. Integrate API Calls: Use fetch or Axios to create a service layer; configure API endpoints and error handling in a dedicated API module.
8. Connect API Data with State: Fetch data in a component using useEffect (or a lifecycle method) and update the global state via your state management solution.
9. Implement UI Routing and Data Flow: Ensure each route properly renders components with necessary props and state, and use dynamic routing where needed.
10. Testing, Debugging, and Deployment: Write unit and integration tests for routing, state updates, and API calls; use browser dev tools for debugging, then optimize and deploy (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

This outline provides a clear roadmap for building a React web application with structured state management, routing, and API integration.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant followed a direct approach to address the user's task of using `cursor-tools` to answer "What is the capital of France?". The assistant correctly identified the need to use the `cursor-tools ask` command. It then employed the `execute_command` tool with the argument `cursor-tools ask "What is the capital of France?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`.

This command was successfully executed, as indicated by the tool output which showed the command execution and the correct answer "Paris" being returned.  Following the successful tool execution, the assistant summarized the outcome and generated a JSON response indicating a "PASS" status, confirming the successful completion of the task and the correct retrieval of the answer using `cursor-tools ask`.
