## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Basic Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a simple question: "What is 2+2?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (4)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully addressed the task by employing the `cursor-tools ask` command to answer the question "What is 2+2?".  The strategy involved utilizing the `execute_command` tool to run the command: `cursor-tools ask "What is 2+2?" --provider openai --model o3-mini`. This command was executed successfully, leveraging the OpenAI o3-mini model to determine the answer.

The `cursor-tools ask` command returned the correct answer "4" as expected, and the execution completed without any critical errors, although a warning about stderr output was present in the tool execution details which was not surfaced as an error in the final summary.  Based on the successful execution and correct answer, the assistant generated a JSON object with a "PASS" status, summarizing the successful outcome and confirming that the task requirements were met.

Successfully executed cursor-tools ask command with OpenAI's o3-mini model. The command returned the correct answer of 4 to the question 'What is 2+2?'
```

#### Expected Behavior


#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 1.20 seconds

---

### Scenario 2: Wait Command (Slow) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask a question that will take longer to process: "Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration."
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include a detailed outline with the requested information
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains a comprehensive outline with the requested components
- Command completes successfully, despite taking longer than other scenarios

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a direct approach to test the `cursor-tools ask` command for complex queries.  It correctly identified the `cursor-tools ask` command as appropriate for answering a question without repository context and formulated the command with the user-provided question, specifying `openai` as the provider and `o3-mini` as the model.

Subsequently, the assistant successfully executed this command using the `execute_command` tool. The tool execution resulted in a comprehensive 10-step outline detailing the creation of a React web application, covering state management, routing, and API integration as requested. The command completed without errors, and the assistant successfully interpreted the output, confirming the successful execution and providing a summary in JSON format indicating a "PASS" status for the test scenario.

1. Set Up the Environment: Install Node.js and npm/yarn, and set up your preferred IDE for development.

2. Bootstrap Your Project: Use create-react-app (or your tool of choice) to scaffold a new React application with built-in support for modern JavaScript and tooling.

3. Define Project Structure: Create a clear folder hierarchy (e.g., components, pages, services, state, hooks) to organize UI components, API utilities, and state management files.

4. Configure Routing: Install react-router-dom, set up a Router in your root component, and define Route components for different pages/views along with navigation links.

5. Plan State Management Strategy: Choose a state management approach (React Context API for simple state or Redux/MobX for more complex scenarios), and install necessary libraries.

6. Set Up Global State: Create state providers (or Redux store) to manage application-wide data, and design actions/reducers or context functions to update state as needed.

7. Build UI Components: Develop reusable functional components using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext), ensuring separation of concerns and component reusability.

8. Integrate API Calls: Use fetch or axios to set up API service modules that handle HTTP requests. Encapsulate API calls in custom hooks or service functions, and manage responses and errors appropriately.

9. Implement Error Handling & Loading States: In both API integration and component state, add proper error handling (try/catch, status validations) and loading indicators to enhance user experience.

10. Test, Optimize, and Deploy: Write unit/integration tests for components, routes, and state logic; optimize performance (code-splitting, lazy loading routes), and build the app for deployment using your chosen hosting platform.

### Scenario 3: Final Ask Command (Fast) (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to ask another simple question: "What is the capital of France?"
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use
- Response should include the correct answer (Paris)
- The command should complete successfully without errors
- AI agent correctly uses the cursor-tools ask command with appropriate provider and model
- Response contains the correct answer
- Command completes within a reasonable time

#### Approach Taken

The assistant successfully executed the user's task by employing the `cursor-tools ask` command to answer the question "What is the capital of France?".  The assistant correctly identified `cursor-tools ask` as the appropriate command and formulated it with the question, specifying `openai` as the provider and `o3-mini` as the model.  The `execute_command` tool was then used to run this command.

The tool execution returned the correct answer "Paris", confirming the successful query.  Although a warning message was present in the stderr, the assistant correctly interpreted the primary output as successful and determined the overall test status as "PASS". The assistant then summarized the outcome in JSON format, highlighting the successful command execution, correct answer, and lack of critical errors.
