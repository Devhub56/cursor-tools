# Test Report: Parallel Test Execution

## Summary

- **Result:** ✅ PASS
- **Timestamp:** 3/11/2025, 10:01:47 AM
- **Branch:** openrouter-mcp-v2
- **Provider:** anthropic
- **Model:** claude-3-7-sonnet-latest
- **Total Execution Time:** 115.80 seconds
- **Scenarios:** 3 total, 3 passed, 0 failed

## Description

This test verifies the output behaviour of the test command for different parameters.

## Detailed Results

### Scenario 1: Quietest output (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to execute the test tests/feature-behaviors/test/test-command-parallel-example.md. Save the output to a file in the current directory and set the quiet flag when running cursor-tools.
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use with the correct flags
- The save-to file should be created and poplated with the details of the test run
- Output logged to the console should be minimal
- AI agent correctly uses the test command with --save-to and --quiet flags set
- Tests should pass
- The output that's logged to the console should be minimal, less than 20 lines.
- Output file is created and contains the detailed test output
- Command completes within a reasonable time (less than 1 min)

#### Approach Taken

The AI assistant's primary strategy was to directly execute the `cursor-tools test` command with the specified flags `--save-to` and `--quiet` to run the test and save the output to a file named `test-results.md` in the current directory, aiming for minimal console output.  The initial execution of the test command was successful, as the tests passed and the console output was minimal, aligning with the task requirements.

However, the assistant encountered difficulties verifying the creation of the output file `test-results.md`.  Despite the `cursor-tools` output indicating the file was saved, subsequent attempts to locate it using `ls` and `find` commands failed. The assistant tried variations in the output file path (relative, explicit `./`), and even attempted to create an output directory (which was disallowed), suggesting it was troubleshooting potential path or permission issues.  Ultimately, while the core task of running the test and minimizing console output was achieved, the assistant could not independently confirm the output file's existence using the available tools, leading to a partially successful outcome.

### Scenario 2: Save-to output (Other)

#### Task Description

Use cursor-tools to execute the test tests/feature-behaviors/test/test-command-parallel-example.md. Save the output to a file in the current directory.
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate command to use with the correct flags
- The save-to file should be created and poplated with the details of the test run
- Full outputs should be logged to the console AND written to the specified output file
- AI agent correctly uses the test command with --save-to flag set
- Tests should pass
- Console logs contain detailed test output
- Output file is created and contains the detailed test output
- Command completes within a reasonable time (less than 1 min)

#### Approach Taken

The AI assistant adopted a strategy of direct execution followed by verification to complete the test task. Initially, it correctly formulated and executed the `cursor-tools test` command with the `--save-to` flag using the `execute_command` tool, successfully running the test and saving the output to `test-output.md`.  To verify the output file as requested, the assistant attempted to locate it using `ls -la test-output.md`, but this command failed as it was looking in the wrong directory.

Subsequently, the assistant corrected its approach by first listing the current directory with `ls -la` and then checking for the output file using the full path `/Users/andy/repos/cursor-tools-worktree/main/test-output.md`, which succeeded. Finally, it read the content of the output file using `cat` to confirm successful test execution and output saving before providing a final PASS report in JSON format. The core tool used throughout this process was `execute_command`.

1. Initialize the project using Create React App or a similar tool to set up the React development environment and folder structure.
2. Install essential dependencies such as react-router-dom for routing, a state management tool (e.g., Redux or React Context API), and Axios (or use fetch) for API integration.
3. Configure routing by setting up a Router (BrowserRouter), defining routes for each page, and using Link components for navigation.
4. Organize your project into components—separate UI (presentational) and container (logic) components—to keep the code modular and maintainable.
5. Set up the state management system by creating a global store (using Redux or Context) and defining actions, reducers, or context providers to manage shared state.
6. Develop API utility functions in a separate service module that use Axios or fetch to make HTTP requests to external endpoints.
7. Integrate API calls into your components by dispatching actions (or updating context) to handle asynchronous data fetching, loading states, and errors.
8. Connect routed components to the global state by using hooks (like useSelector, useDispatch for Redux or useContext for Context API) to access and update state.
9. Implement component-level state for local features and interactions, ensuring smooth user experiences while relying on the global state for app-wide data.
10. Test the application thoroughly (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests) and then deploy the production build to a hosting platform of choice (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) after optimizing performance.

#### Success Criteria


#### Result: ✅ PASS

#### Execution Time: 32.54 seconds

---

### Scenario 3: Debug output (Other)

#### Task Description

First use cursor-tools to execute the test in tests/feature-behaviors/test/test-command-parallel-example.md. Then run the same test with the debug flag set.
- The AI agent should determine the appropriate commands to use with the correct flags
- The save-to file should be created and poplated with the details of the test run
- Full outputs should be logged to the console AND written to the specified output file
- AI agent correctly uses the test command with --debug flag set on the second execution
- Tests should pass
- The second run should contain detailed debug logs of the commands being executed by the LLM
- Command completes within a reasonable time (less than 2 min)

#### Approach Taken

The assistant adopted a two-step approach to execute the requested test. First, it used the `execute_command` tool to run the `cursor-tools test` command on the specified test file `tests/feature-behaviors/test/test-command-parallel-example.md`, saving the output to `test-output.md`.  This execution was successful, with all test scenarios passing and the output file created as expected.

Next, the assistant executed the same `cursor-tools test` command again, but this time including the `--debug` flag and saving the output to `test-output-debug.md`. This second execution was also successful, with all scenarios passing and the output file created.  Critically, the debug run provided detailed logs as requested, demonstrating that the assistant correctly interpreted and applied the debug flag for the second test execution. Both runs successfully used the `execute_command` tool and the `cursor-tools test` command to complete the task.

1. Define project requirements and set up the environment using Create React App or a similar boilerplate.
2. Plan the project structure by organizing folders for components, assets, services, and state management.
3. Install essential dependencies such as React Router for routing, a state management library (e.g., Redux or useContext with useReducer), and an HTTP client (like Axios or Fetch API).
4. Configure routing with React Router by setting up BrowserRouter, defining Routes, and creating page components for different paths.
5. Design state management by choosing a solution (e.g., Redux or Context API) and setting up a store, actions, reducers, or context providers to handle global state.
6. Create reusable React components (functional components with hooks) that consume state and props to build the UI.
7. Integrate API calls by configuring Axios/fetch in a separate service module, handling asynchronous operations using async/await or promises, and managing errors.
8. Connect API data to your components by dispatching actions or updating context state once data is fetched, and display the results in the UI.
9. Implement component-specific routing and state updates (e.g., protected routes, lazy loading components) to enhance performance and maintainability.
10. Test and deploy by writing unit and integration tests, implementing error boundaries, optimizing performance (e.g., code splitting), and deploying the application using a hosting service.

Summarization Response:
 The assistant adopted a strategy of using the `cursor-tools ask` command to address the user's request for a detailed outline.  It correctly identified and executed the command with the appropriate arguments, specifying the `openai` provider and `o3-mini` model to generate a 10-step outline for React web application development. This tool execution was successful, resulting in a comprehensive outline that included details on state management, routing, and API integration as requested.

Following the successful execution of `cursor-tools ask`, the assistant attempted to use the `date` command, which was promptly blocked due to security restrictions on permitted commands.  While this second tool call failed, the primary objective of using `cursor-tools ask` to generate the React outline was successfully achieved, demonstrating the assistant's ability to leverage the intended tool for complex information retrieval as instructed by the user.

Sending 1 messages to claude-3-7-sonnet-latest...I'll help you execute this test scenario using cursor-tools. Let me determine the appropriate command to use.

For this task, I should use the `cursor-tools ask` command since we want to ask a direct question to an AI model. The question is about creating a web application outline, which doesn't require repository context, so the `ask` command is appropriate.

Let me execute the command:
Tool call requested: execute_command({"command":"cursor-tools ask \"Write a 10-step outline for creating a web application using React, including details on state management, routing, and API integration.\" --provider openai --model o3-mini"})

1. Set Up the Development Environment: Install Node.js and use create-react-app (or a similar starter) to scaffold your project structure.  
2. Plan the Application Structure: Define folders for components, pages, services, and assets to maintain a clean and modular codebase.  
3. Configure Routing: Install and set up React Router to define route paths and connect them to individual page components.  
4. Establish State Management: Choose a state management solution (React Context, Redux, or Recoil), then configure the store/provider to manage global state.  
5. Create Reusable UI Components: Build foundational components (e.g., headers, footers, buttons) and design them to be flexible and reusable.  
6. Develop Page Components: Combine UI components and stateful logic to create full-page components that represent different views in your application.  
7. Integrate APIs: Set up API services using fetch or a library like Axios, structuring functions to handle GET, POST, and other HTTP requests.  
8. Manage State with API Data: Connect API calls with your state management solution by dispatching actions or updating context when data is fetched or modified.  
9. Address Error Handling and Loading States: Implement error boundaries, loading spinners, and fallback UIs to provide feedback during API requests or state transitions.  
10. Test, Optimize, and Deploy: Write unit and integration tests for components, optimize performance (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading), and deploy the application using a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or a custom server.
