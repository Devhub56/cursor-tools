Cursor-tools is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides additional cursor functionality. Its main features are:

1. Ability to place "anchors" at cursor positions in a document
2. Create multiple cursors from those anchors later
3. Sub-word navigation

The key capabilities include:

- Placing anchors at cursor positions to mark locations in the document
- Creating multiple cursors at all anchor positions with a single command
- Sub-word navigation to move the cursor between parts of camelCase or snake_case words

It allows developers to easily create multiple cursors at predefined positions, which can be useful for bulk editing tasks. The sub-word navigation feature also improves cursor movement within compound words.

The extension can be installed from the Visual Studio Code marketplace. It adds new commands and keyboard shortcuts to VS Code for placing anchors, creating cursors from anchors, and sub-word navigation.
