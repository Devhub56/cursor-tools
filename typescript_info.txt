Querying perplexity using sonar-pro for: What is TypeScript? with maxTokens: 8000
TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript by adding static typing and other features[1][2]. Here are the key points about TypeScript:

1. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code[2][3].

2. TypeScript adds optional static typing to JavaScript. This allows developers to add type annotations to variables, function parameters, and return values[3][4].

3. It compiles to plain JavaScript, which can run in any environment that supports JavaScript (browsers, Node.js, etc.)[2][4].

4. TypeScript offers additional features like interfaces, enums, generics, and more advanced object-oriented programming concepts[2][5].

5. It provides better tooling support, including enhanced autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring in IDEs[3][4].

6. TypeScript helps catch errors earlier in the development process through its static type checking[4][6].

7. It's designed for developing large-scale applications, making it easier to manage and maintain complex codebases[2][4].

8. TypeScript uses type inference, meaning it can often infer types even when they're not explicitly declared[5].

9. It supports modern JavaScript features and can compile them down to older versions of JavaScript for broader compatibility[6].

10. TypeScript has gained significant popularity in recent years, with many major companies and projects adopting it for both frontend and backend development[6].

By using TypeScript, developers can write more robust and maintainable code, catch potential errors earlier, and take advantage of advanced language features while still leveraging the vast JavaScript ecosystem.
