This repository is dedicated to the development of **cursor-tools**, a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to enhance the capabilities of AI agents, particularly within the Cursor editor.

Here are the main features of this repository:

1.  **AI-Powered Commands**: The repository builds a CLI tool that offers a range of AI-driven commands, designed to be used by AI agents. These commands act as "teammates" or "skills" for AI agents, allowing them to perform various tasks.

2.  **Diverse AI Teammates**: The tool integrates with multiple AI providers, effectively creating an "AI team" for different tasks:
    *   **Perplexity**: For web search and research.
    *   **Gemini 2.0**: For in-depth repository context analysis and implementation planning, leveraging its large context window.
    *   **Stagehand**: For browser automation, enabling web application testing and debugging, utilizing Anthropic or OpenAI models.

3.  **Specialized Skills**: Beyond general AI queries, `cursor-tools` provides specialized skills:
    *   **GitHub Integration**: Enables AI agents to interact with GitHub issues and pull requests.
    *   **Xcode Tools**:  Offers commands for building, running, and linting Xcode projects for iOS development.
    *   **Documentation Generation**: Allows AI agents to generate documentation for both local and remote GitHub repositories using Gemini 2.0.
    *   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support**:  Enables interaction with specialized tools via MCP servers.
    *   **ClickUp Integration**: Allows interaction with ClickUp tasks.
    *   **Browser Automation**: Provides tools for browser-based tasks like web testing and data extraction using Stagehand.

4.  **Focus on Cursor Integration**: The tool is designed to seamlessly integrate with the Cursor editor, providing command suggestions, usage examples, and context-aware assistance through Cursor project rules.

5.  **Testing Framework**: The repository includes a sophisticated testing framework specifically designed for AI agent-based testing, featuring:
    *   Feature behavior files to describe test scenarios.
    *   Parallel test execution for faster results.
    *   Detailed reporting in Markdown format.
    *   Mechanisms for handling retries and timeouts.

6.  **Configuration Flexibility**: `cursor-tools` is highly configurable, allowing users to customize:
    *   AI provider and model selection for different commands.
    *   API keys and authentication methods.
    *   Behavior of Repomix for repository context creation.
    *   Browser automation settings.

7.  **Emphasis on Practicality and Real-World Use**: The tool is designed to be production-ready and focuses on solving real-world problems for developers using AI agents, particularly within the Cursor editor.

In essence, this repository is building a powerful CLI tool that acts as a versatile toolkit for AI agents, significantly expanding their capabilities for coding, research, planning, and automation, with a strong emphasis on integration with the Cursor editor.
