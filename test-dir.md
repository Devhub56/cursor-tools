Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: What is the current working directory?
The current working directory is where you're currently located in the file system. Here are a few key things to know about accessing the current working directory:

1. To see the current working directory, use the `pwd` command in Terminal. This stands for "print working directory" and will show you the full path.

2. When you open a new Terminal window, the default working directory is usually your home directory (e.g. /Users/yourusername/).

3. In single-user mode, as mentioned in the instructions, the default working directory is /private/var/root.

4. The memtest.log file will be saved in whatever the current working directory is when you run the memtest command.

5. To access the log file, you'll need to navigate to wherever it was saved. For example:

   - If in single-user mode: `cd /private/var/root`
   - Then use `ls` to list files and look for memtest.log
   - You can view it with a command like `cat memtest.log`

6. If you're back in the full OS, you may need to use root/admin privileges to access files created in single-user mode.

The key is using `pwd` to determine where you are, then navigating to the appropriate location to find the log file. Let me know if you need any clarification on accessing the file!
